# Understanding Variable Assignment and Output
# What is a variable in Python, and what kinds of values can it store?
# Answer: A variable is a container that stores values such as integers, floats, booleans, list and strings.

# Given name = "Alice", what will print(name) output?
# Answer: Alice

# What is the difference between print(first_name) and print("first_name") in Python?
# Answer: first_name is a variable and "first_name is a string.


# Using F-Strings for Output
# How would you print the variable first_name within a sentence using an f-string, such as "Hello, Sherrard!"?
# Answer:
first_name = "Sherrard"
print(f"Hello, {first_name}!")


# Types of String Content
# What types of characters can strings contain in Python? Give examples of each (letters, numbers, symbols, punctuation, emojis, whitespace).
# Answer: strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, punctuation, emojis, and whitespace
# letters- A,B,C | a,b,c
# numbers- 1,2,3 | 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
# symbols- ^@#$%
# punctuation- .!?
# emojis- 😀😁😂🤣😃😄
whitespace =  "   Hello   " + "\n\tnew user"
print(whitespace)

# Define and give an example of a "whitespace" character.
#answer: Whitespace is the intentional empty space between characters or blank space on a line normally executed by
# using the space bar, tab or enter key.
city = "     boston    "
print(city)

# Why is it considered best practice to use double quotation marks for strings in Python?
# Answer: Because some strings use words that have apostrophe which makes it difficult to tell where a string ends
# resulting in an error message.
# Example:
# print('Sherrard's python course') # results in error message
# print("Sherrard's python course") # results- Sherrard's python course

# Experimenting with Different String Values
# If message = "Hello! 😀", what will print(message) output?
# Answer:
message = "Hello! 😀"
print(message)

# Create a variable welcome_message and assign it the value "Welcome to Python!" using single quotes.
# Print the value of welcome_message.
welcome_message = 'Welcome to Python!'
print(welcome_message)

# Character Types
# Define what a "character" is in Python and give examples of:
# Answer: A character is any key on a computer keyboard that results in text or space

# Alphanumeric characters
# Example: A,B,C

# Special characters
# Example: @#$

# Whitespace characters
# Example: space bar, tab or enter key

# Note to self
# Need to find a way to print individual lines of code
